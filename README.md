# PracticalMachineLearningProject
Prediction project for Coursera's Practical Machine Learning offered by Johns Hopkins University
This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. 
This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, 
as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage. The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the 
NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events: the events having the most effect on human health, 
and the events having the greatest economic impact.

The code to run the project is included in the .rmd document.  This code uses both the plyr and graphics packages of r in 
addition to the r base package.  Data is cleaned prior to aggregation.  Assumptions are listed in the document.  Because others 
may have different working assumptions, the data aggregation may show different results than other projects.
